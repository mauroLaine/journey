## Overview

I really enjoyed this visit to the Valley of Fire State Park. The landscape was insane and looked like Mars or any other scenes from a fiction film. And, I was told that Valley of Fire had been a location for many famous film scenes like Star Trek Generations and Viva Las Vegas. Furthermore, I could see some rock art from the prehistoric inhabitants of the Valley of Fire.

## Big Horn
I was so lucky to see a Big Horn Sheep next to the road.

I went to Valley of Fire in the middle of summer, and due to the highest temperatures outside, we couldn't stay longer in sandstones. So, I want to revisit this place in the winter months and spend more time exploring.
