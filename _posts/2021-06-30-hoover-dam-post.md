## Overview

This experience is one of my highlights from this year. I was kayaking around 12 miles from the Hoover Dam to Willow Beach, AZ. The journey was almost 7 hours in the water, and I could visit the following sites: 
* Hoover Dam
* Arizona Hot springs
* Hike into the Gold Strike Canyon
* Emerald Cave
* Black Canyon

## Hot Springs

Also, during my trip, I could relax in some Hot Springs. The water was so hot and chill. I want to repeat this experience soon!
