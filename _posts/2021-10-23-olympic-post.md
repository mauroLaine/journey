## Overview

I went to Olympic National Park in the middle of Autumn, waiting to see the orange foliage around the mountains. And, I saw what I was expecting, a mixture of orange, red and yellow in the trees. It was worth the trip, and I got astonished by the variety of colors. 

It was so beautiful and everything that I was waiting for. This post shows some of the delightful viewpoints of this reservation.

### Deers

When coming down from the Hurricane Ridge area, I had the chance to take close pictures of some deers who were next to road.

I can't wait to visit this National Park in summer, and check the Hurricane Ridge without clouds.
