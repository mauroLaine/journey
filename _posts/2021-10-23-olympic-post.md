## Overview

I went to Olympic National Park in the middle of Autumn, waiting to see the orange foliage around the mountains. I couldn't be more surprised by the variety of colors. 

It was so beautiful and everything that I expected. And, this post shows some of the delightful viewpoints of this reservation.

### Deers

When coming down from the Hurricane Ridge area, I had the chance to take close pictures of some deers who were next to road.
