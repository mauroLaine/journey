## Overview

Visiting Zion National Park is an incredible experience. I went at the end of June, and it was hot out there, but I had so much fun exploring the paths. Also, it was the best season for visiting the narrows trail, which is one of the main attractions of this park and the narrowest section of Zion Canyon. During my journey, I saw the following viewpoints:

* Lower Emerald Pool trail
* Riverside walk
* Temple of Sinawava
* The narrows
* Canyon Overlook

### The narrows

This hike was the most fun part of my trip. I hiked around 4 miles into the narrows trail. The water was cold and reached out my hips. However, it has been one of my best outdoor experiences due to challenge and the beautiful landscape through the way.

I hope to come back soon, and do the Angels Landing hike.
